# mvc-project

## Initial Notes

-  I started with `tdd-project` but that was meant to be a React app
-  This will instead be based on `dotnet new mvc`

-  I'm honestly not sure if I can use vitest or not.  Not sure about how compatability works with testing frameworks.  Let's just try it out.  lol
-  goddammit i hate testing framework bullshit.  i can't get any of these to interact with each other.

- Following this guide:

### Running, testing, etc notes
-  `dotnet watch` will run the app in hot reload mode
-  how about a quick green box, eh?  lol.
